This is a set of 1-octave major scales (plus a 1-octave chromatic scale) for beginning band, aligned to the ATSSB Region 1 MS/JH All-Region Band audition scales. This is meant to build off of [Beginner Tetrachords](https://github.com/pzybak/Beginner-Tetrachords), and each scale lists the two tetrachords that comprise it. This repository contains PDF files of the full score and parts, as well as the MuseScore file in case you need to make any changes to better suit your students.
